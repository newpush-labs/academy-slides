# 📚 NewPush Academy Slides Repository

Welcome to the NewPush Academy Slides repository page! This space is designed to help our team members and teachers understand how our slides are maintained, deployed, and accessed. 🚀

## Overview

We host our course slides in a dedicated GitHub repository. This approach allows us to:
- Treat slides as software: Manage changes, releases, and history using Git.
- Facilitate collaboration: Accept pull requests (PRs) from team members and teachers to continually improve the content.
- Leverage Markdown & AI: Easily create, edit, and refine content with Markdown and AI tools.
- Automate Deployment: Our Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline automatically deploys new slides as they are merged.

## Why Use GitHub for Slides?
- Version Control & History: Every change is tracked, so you can always revert if needed.
- Collaborative Workflow: Team members can submit PRs for updates, making the review and update process smooth.
- Integration with CI/CD: Automatic deployment ensures that the most recent version is always online.
- Future Website Integration: Once the slides are updated in GitHub, we will link them directly on the [NewPush Academy website](https://www.newpush.com).

## Continuous Integration (CI)

Our CI pipeline monitors the repository and automatically deploys any new or updated slides. This means that as soon as your contributions are merged, the latest version of the slides is live and available for everyone. 🌟
