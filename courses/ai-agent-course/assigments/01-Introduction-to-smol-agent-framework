# Assignment 1: Introduction to AI Agents & smol Framework

## Learning Objectives
By completing this assignment, you will:
- Set up essential accounts for AI development
- Learn the fundamentals of AI agents through hands-on experience
- Build your first AI agent using the smol framework

## Tasks

### 1. Account Setup (10 points)
Create accounts on the following platforms:
- [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/join)
- [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/signup)
- [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com/signup)
- [Google AI (Gemini)](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)

For each platform, save your API keys securely - you'll need them later.

### 2. Complete Hugging Face Course (40 points)
1. Enroll in the [Hugging Face Agents Course Unit 1](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit1/introduction)
2. Complete all sections in Unit 1
3. Take screenshots of your completion status

### 3. Build Your First Agent (50 points)
Create a simple but creative AI agent using the smol framework. Your agent should:

- Implement at least one custom tool
- Use chain-of-thought reasoning
- Solve a specific, well-defined problem

Example project ideas:
- A recipe converter that adjusts ingredients based on serving size
- A coding assistant that explains and refactors code
- A travel planner that suggests itineraries based on constraints

#### Submission Requirements
1. Source code of your agent
2. README.md explaining:
   - What your agent does
   - How to run it
   - Example inputs and outputs
3. Brief reflection on challenges faced and how you overcame them

## Evaluation Criteria
- Account setup with proof (10%)
- Course completion with reflection (40%)
- Agent implementation:
  - Functionality (20%)
  - Code quality (15%)
  - Creativity (15%)

## Submission Instructions
Submit your assignment as a git repository on github containing:
- Course completion proof and reflection
- Your agent's code repository

## Due Date
Two weeks from assignment date
