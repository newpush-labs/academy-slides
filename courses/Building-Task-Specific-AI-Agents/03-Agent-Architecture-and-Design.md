# What are AI Agents?

**Definition:**

An AI agent is an autonomous system that perceives its environment, reasons through data, and acts to achieve specific goals. They can be built using rule-based methods or advanced learning models.

**Key Features:**
- Autonomy in decision making
- Goal-oriented actions
- Adaptive learning from feedback

# Agent Design Patterns

**Common Patterns**

<div>

## Reactive Agents  

- Respond to stimuli in real-time  
- Simple and efficient for straightforward tasks
</div>
<div>

## Deliberative Agents  

- Plan actions based on internal models  
- Suitable for complex problem-solving
</div>
<div>

## Hybrid Agents  

- Combine reactive and deliberative approaches  
- Balance between responsiveness and planning

# Memory Systems and State Management

Effective memory systems are crucial for AI agents to maintain context and improve decision-making over time.

**Types of Memory:**
- **Short-Term Memory:** Temporary storage for immediate tasks.
- **Long-Term Memory:** Persistent storage for knowledge and experiences.
- **Episodic Memory:** Records of specific events and interactions.

---

# Planning and Reasoning Strategies

AI agents use various strategies to plan and reason through tasks.

**Key Strategies:**
- **Forward Planning:** Predicting future states based on current actions.
- **Backward Planning:** Working backward from the goal to determine necessary steps.
- **Heuristic Methods:** Using rules of thumb to make decisions efficiently.

---

# Tools and APIs Integration

AI agents often rely on external tools and APIs to extend their capabilities.

**Integration Techniques:**
- **APIs and Web Services:** Accessing external data or performing computations.
- **Databases:** Storing and retrieving structured data.
- **Custom Utilities:** Specific functions designed to solve sub-tasks.

Tools communicate with agents using standardized data formats such as JSON.

# Error Handling and Fallback Mechanisms

Robust error handling is essential for reliable AI agents.

**Approaches:**
- **Graceful Degradation:** Ensuring the agent continues to function at a reduced capacity.
- **Fallback Mechanisms:** Alternative strategies when primary methods fail.
- **Logging and Monitoring:** Tracking errors and performance for continuous improvement.

# Workshop: Designing an Agent Architecture

In this workshop, we will design an AI agent architecture that:

1. Defines a problem and gathers input.
2. Implements perception, reasoning, and action functions.
3. Integrates external tools via APIs.
4. Handles errors and employs fallback mechanisms.
5. Utilizes memory systems for state management.

Follow along as we design the agent step-by-step.

# Summary & Recap

**Key Takeaways:**

- AI agents operate through a cycle of perception, reasoning, and action.
- Effective memory systems enhance decision-making.
- Planning and reasoning strategies are crucial for complex tasks.
- Integration with external tools using APIs ensures scalable and flexible agent design.
- Robust error handling and fallback mechanisms are vital for building reliable agents.
