# What are AI Agents?

**Definition:**

**Key Features:**
- Autonomy in decision making
- Goal-oriented actions
- Adaptive learning from feedback

<!-- Speaker Notes:
- Define what an AI agent is and its core characteristics.
- Discuss the importance of autonomy, goal orientation, and adaptive learning.
- Provide examples of AI agents in various domains.

# Agent Design Patterns

**Common Patterns**

<div grid="~ cols-3 gap-4">
<div>

## Reactive Agents  

- Respond to stimuli in real-time  
- Simple stimulus-response mapping
- No internal state representation
- Examples: Thermostat, basic chatbots
</div>
<div>

## Deliberative Agents  

- Plan actions based on internal models  
- Maintain world representations
- Consider future consequences
- Examples: Chess AI, route planners
</div>
<div>

## Hybrid Agents  

- Combine reactive and deliberative approaches  
- Balance between responsiveness and planning

# BDI Architecture

The **Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI)** architecture is a popular framework for designing intelligent agents.

**Components:**
- **Beliefs:** The agent's knowledge about the world
- **Desires:** Goals the agent wants to achieve
- **Intentions:** Commitments to specific action plans

**Implementation:**
- Beliefs are typically stored in a knowledge base
- Desires are represented as goal states
- Intentions are managed through a commitment strategy

This architecture provides a clear separation between knowledge, goals, and actions, making it easier to design complex agent behaviors.

<!-- Speaker Notes:
- Introduce the BDI architecture and its components: Beliefs, Desires, and Intentions.
- Explain how each component functions and interacts within the architecture.
- Discuss the benefits of using BDI for designing complex agent behaviors.

# Planning and Reasoning Strategies

AI agents use various strategies to plan and reason through tasks.

**Key Strategies:**
