# Key Concepts: Tokens and Context Windows

**Tokens:**
- Basic units of text processing
- Words, subwords, or characters
- Impact on model performance
- Usage monitoring and optimization

**Context Windows:**
- Maximum input/output length
- Memory limitations
- Information retention
- Strategic content management

<!--
Understanding tokens and context windows is crucial for effective AI interaction:

Tokens are the fundamental units that models use to process text. A token might be a word, part of a word, or even a single character. Understanding tokenization helps optimize your inputs and manage costs.

Context windows define how much information the model can consider at once. This affects everything from conversation length to document analysis capabilities. Learning to work within these constraints is key to successful AI implementation.

These concepts directly impact how you structure your interactions with AI models and influence the quality of results you can achieve.
-->

# Key Concepts: Temperature and Prompting

**Temperature:**
- Controls output randomness
- Low (0.0-0.3): Consistent, focused
- Medium (0.3-0.7): Balanced
- High (0.7-1.0): Creative, varied

**Prompting:**
- Clear instruction crafting
- Context provision
- Format specification
- Iterative refinement

<!--
Temperature and prompting are critical parameters that influence AI output:

Temperature acts like a creativity dial. Lower values produce more predictable, factual responses, while higher values encourage more creative and diverse outputs. Choose based on your specific needs - lower for technical documentation, higher for creative writing.

Effective prompting is an art that combines clear instructions with appropriate context. Good prompts are specific, well-structured, and provide examples when needed. Learning to craft effective prompts is perhaps the most important skill in AI interaction.
-->

# Hands-on: Basic Prompt Engineering

**Real-world Examples:**

1. **Technical Documentation:**
   ```python
   # API Documentation Example
   prompt = """
   Write API documentation for a function that:
   - Name: process_payment
   - Parameters: amount (float), currency (str), user_id (str)
   - Returns: transaction_id or error
   Include example usage and error handling.
   """
   ```

2. **Creative Writing:**
   ```python
   # Story Generation Example
   prompt = """
   Write a short story about space exploration:
   - Setting: Mars colony, year 2150
   - Theme: Discovery and survival
   - Style: Hard science fiction
   - Length: 3 paragraphs
   Focus on scientific accuracy and human elements.
   """
   ```

3. **Data Analysis:**
   ```python
   # Market Analysis Example
   prompt = """
   Analyze the following market data:
   Revenue: $1.2M (Q1), $1.5M (Q2), $1.8M (Q3)
   Customer Growth: 15%, 18%, 22%
   Churn Rate: 5%, 4.8%, 4.2%

   Provide:
   1. Key trends
   2. Growth analysis
   3. Recommendations
   """

**Common Pitfalls to Avoid:**
- Vague instructions
- Insufficient context
- Overcomplicating prompts
- Ignoring model limitations

<!--
Following best practices significantly improves AI interaction results:

Specificity is crucial - the more precise your instructions, the better the output. Include format requirements, tone preferences, and any other relevant parameters.

Context helps the model understand your needs better. Provide background information and examples when relevant, but avoid overwhelming with unnecessary details.

Iteration is key to success. Start with simple prompts and refine based on the results. Learn from what works and what doesn't.

Remember to work within the model's limitations. Understanding these constraints helps set realistic expectations and achieve better results.

# Exercise: Writing Effective Prompts

**Scenario 1: Technical Writing**
- Document a software feature
- Create user instructions
- Explain complex concepts

**Scenario 2: Creative Content**
- Generate marketing copy
- Write engaging stories
- Develop social media content

**Scenario 3: Analysis**
- Market research summary
- Data interpretation
- Trend analysis

<!--
Let's apply what we've learned with practical exercises:

For technical writing, focus on clarity and accuracy. Your prompts should specify the technical level and target audience.

Creative content requires a balance of guidance and freedom. Specify brand voice, target audience, and key messages while allowing room for creativity.

Analysis prompts should clearly outline the scope, required depth, and expected format of the results.

These exercises help develop intuition for what makes an effective prompt in different contexts.

- Bias in training data and outputs
- Privacy and data protection
- Environmental impact
- Societal implications

**Best Practices:**
- Regular bias assessment
- Transparent usage policies
- Responsible deployment
- User consent and control

<!--
Ethics must be central to AI implementation:

AI models can perpetuate or amplify existing biases if not carefully managed. Understanding these challenges helps develop responsible usage practices.

Consider both direct impacts (like data privacy) and broader implications (like environmental costs of training large models). Implementing ethical guidelines early helps ensure responsible AI development.
