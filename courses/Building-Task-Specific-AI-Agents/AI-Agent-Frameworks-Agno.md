# Agno Agent Framework: A Deep Dive

## A Comprehensive Overview**

---

# Introduction

*   AI agents are revolutionizing how we interact with technology.
*   Agno is an open-source framework designed for building multi-modal AI agents using Python
*   This presentation provides a detailed exploration of Agno, its features, capabilities, and applications.

---

# What is Agno?

*   Agno is an open-source framework for building multi-modal AI agents
*   Lightweight and modular architecture
*   Uses pure Python code for agent development
*   Designed for performance and scale
*   Supports any model provider

---

# Key Features and Capabilities

*   **Simplicity:** Pure Python code, no complex graphs or chains
*   **Performance:**  Up to 10,000 times faster than Langraph, low memory usage
*   **Model Agnostic:** Compatible with any LLM, provider, or modality
*   **Multi-modal Support:** Supports text, image, audio, and video
*   **Memory Management:** Built-in memory management for contextual awareness
*   **Structured Outputs:** Ensures predictable and consistent responses
*   **Real-time Monitoring:** Facilitates monitoring of agent states and performance
*   **Agentic RAG:** Utilizes Retrieval-Augmented Generation by default
*   **Knowledge Stores:** Supports various vector databases
*   **Multi-Agent Teams:** Enables creation of collaborative agent teams
*   **Agent Playground:** Provides a user-friendly interface for testing agents

# Agent Levels

Agno categorizes agents into four levels:

*   **Level 0:** Basic agents with no tools.
*   **Level 1:** Agents with tools for autonomous task execution.
*   **Level 2:** Agents with knowledge, memory, and reasoning.
*   **Level 3:** Teams of agents collaborating on complex workflows.

# Example Code - Basic Agent

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat

agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    description="This is a helpful AI assistant.",
)

agent.print_response("What is the capital of France?")
```

---

# Example Code - Agent with Tools

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.groq import Groq
from agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools

agent = Agent(
    model=Groq(id="llama-3.3-70b-versatile"),
    description="You are an enthusiastic news reporter with a flair for storytelling!",
    tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()],
    show_tool_calls=True,
    markdown=True
)

agent.print_response("Tell me about a breaking news story from New York.", stream=True)
```
